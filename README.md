# Overview

A deep learning project centered around identifying successful funding applicants to a charity named 'AIphabet Soup'.

# How To Use

Take a peek at the report.md to see the results that I got when running the code. 

If you would like to run this on your own, you'll need a Python environment with all of the necessary packages installed.  
Use your preferred method of running notebooks, and run all cells! Results could vary from what I saw when I ran it all.
